# GoldBadgeForReal

I wanted to approach this project as much like I would a "real job" as possible, so as I began I created methods under Tools.cs in 00_Helpful_Methods
to do common tasks more easily in the three projects.  While this slowed me down a while, and kept me from getting things as tightened up as I would have
liked, it certainly felt more like I was coding efficiently and in my own wheelhouse.

Much to my surprise, I was able to get the projects to their current state without asking for help from the Eleven Fifty staff! While I probably should have
for the one thing that I know I missed in the project scopes (I'm not going to tell you what it was!) my hope is to keep working it myself to see if I can 
get it.

I chose the Green, Greeting, and Menu Projects in that order.  I also chose to do things almost entirely through menus given that it is a console app.  I think
I found some creative ways to get menu items and retrieve items from lists without pushing everything out every time.

To the best I can tell, my programs are all working, all menus are working, the CRUD methods are all good, and the information is all accurate as it is added,
updated and deleted.  My testing units were all successful, and working through them three times on my own made me much more clear on how to do them.

Each project has seeded information, so you can check all of my work without going through the Add process first.
